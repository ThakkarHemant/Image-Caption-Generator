# Image-Caption-Generator
Image captioning is a challenging task in the field of computer vision and natural language processing. The goal of this project is to create a model that can accurately describe the content of an image using natural language. This is achieved by combining the power of CNNs for image feature extraction and LSTMs for sequence modeling.
This project implements an image caption generator using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. It takes an image as input and generates a descriptive caption for that image.

# Dataset
The model is trained on flick8k  dataset.
